# Welcome to Spring Web Bootcamp 2022

In this full-stack bootcamp, you will learn how a variety of technologies work together. We'll cover technologies ranging from Reactjs for the frontend to nodejs and expressjs for the server side of our web app. We'll start with creating a basic frontend using React, creating APIs to integrating our frontend with the backend. This will be an interactive bootcamp where you can put your learnings to test via tasks & a project.
